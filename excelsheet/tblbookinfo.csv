As chief of the country's defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is about science.",NULL,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634583.Wings_of_Fire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=4iBZJ4u6GH&rank=1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

This method, which anticipated such contemporary developments as performance analysis and the semiotics of drama, is here applied to representative texts from key periods of the history of drama: the Greek stage, the medieval theatre-in-the-round and pageant-wagon, the Elizabethan public playhouse, London commercial theatres from the Restoration to the late 19th century, the naturalist stage of the Moscow Art Theatre, 20th century experimental drama, and contemporary film.",NULL,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3670434-drama-in-performance?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=nfiBuUGRQT&rank=2,78516,1,"824 / WIL","Penguin, England",13.00,₹,194,2,1120,5,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
